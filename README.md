# Weather-App
A web project built to demonstrate API usage and display it in a web project. 

Note the API key is hidden and so will either need to be replaced with your own key or I can provide you with my key.

This project was created using HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Express.js, OpenWeather API, Axios. This project makes call to the API for the latest weather of a location either by name or coordinates.
The information is then displayed in a appropriate manner and the search result is the first one for named locations. The colour scheme and images are based on the type of weather.
The project uses a .env file to hide API keys, but the file is not included in the git repository.

Thank you for viewing my project and if there are any improvements/questions. please let me know.
